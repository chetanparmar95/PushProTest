## Question Id - 1:

The challenge is to build a mobile that displays and showcases the Rocstart of EPNS V2 NFT collections. Read more about the Rockstar NFTs [HERE](https://opensea.io/collection/rockstars-of-epns-v2).

This NFT collection includes around 100 different items(NFTs). A specific individual item in the collection looks like [this](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa2b885e7065ea59a3251489715ca80de5ff642f8/1).

## Intended Behaviour of the Mobile App:

- Display the NFT collection as a list with at least the following attributes:
  - Name of that NFT token
  - Owner address of that specific NFT
  - The image or animation associated with the NFT
- User should be able to bookmark the NFT token they like
- Use local storage to save the bookmark
- User can see the items they bookmarked
- User can remove their bookmarks
- The App layout can be a Single Screen with two Tabs.
  - One for showing all NFTS
  - The other for showing the bookmarked NFTs.
